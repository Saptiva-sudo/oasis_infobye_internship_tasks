# Oasis Infobyte Internship 
This repository contains 3 tasks that were completed successfully for the Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte.


## TASK 2
### UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during COVID-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project. 
#### Dataset :
Unemployment dataset from **Kaggle** : [DATASET](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gokulrajkmv/unemployment-in-india)
#### Project Steps :
1. Data Preprocessing : Load the unemployment in India dataset and inspect its structure.
2. Data Analysis : Explore the dataset by visualizing the relationships between different features.
3. Data Splitting : Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Model Training : Select multiple machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks, train each model using the training data.
5. Model Evaluation : Evaluate the trained models using the testing data.

## TASK 3
### CAR PRICE PREDICTION
Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. By considering these features we can train a model that can learn from the given data and make predictions accordingly with Machine Learning.
#### Dataset :
Car dataset from **Kaggle** : [DATASET](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayaadithyanvg/car-price-predictionused-cars)
#### Project Steps :
1. Data Preprocessing : Load the car dataset and inspect its structure.
2. Data Analysis : Explore the dataset by visualizing the relationships between different features.
3. Data Splitting : Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Model Training : Select multiple machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks, train each model using the training data.
5. Model Evaluation : Evaluate the trained models using the testing data.

## TASK 5
### SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.
#### Dataset :
Sales dataset from **Kaggle** : [DATASET](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bumba5341/advertisingcsv)
#### Project Steps :
1. Data Preprocessing : Load the sales dataset and inspect its structure and mathematical statistics.
2. Data Analysis : Explore the dataset by visualizing the relationships between different features.
3. Data Splitting : Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Model Training : Select multiple machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks, train each model using the training data.
5. Model Evaluation : Evaluate the trained models using the testing data.
